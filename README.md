Project Overview

1. Daily Forecast Project

Focuses on short-term trends.
Implements techniques like:
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling).
Forecasting models such as ARIMA or LSTM.
Objective: Predict daily values with high accuracy.
2. Monthly Forecast Project

Explores medium-term forecasting over months.
Includes:
Aggregation of daily data into monthly summaries.
Seasonal decomposition and trend analysis.
Objective: Identify seasonal and cyclical patterns in the data.
3. Yearly Forecast Project

Focuses on long-term forecasting over years.
Techniques:
Modeling yearly trends and periodic components.
Application of models like SARIMA or Prophet.
Objective: Provide insights into long-term trends and growth.
Features

Comprehensive data preprocessing pipelines.
Time-series visualizations for trend, seasonality, and residual analysis.
Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
Forecasting using advanced machine learning and statistical methods.
Requirements
